This garage project is designed to automate the entry and exit of cars using an ATmega32 microcontroller and servo motors to control barriers or gates. The project uses two infrared (IR) sensors, labeled as "Entry" and "Exit," to detect the presence of vehicles at the garage's entrance and exit.

### Project Components :
1. **ATmega32 Microcontroller (U1)**: This is the central unit controlling the logic of the project. It processes signals from the IR sensors and controls the servo motors accordingly.

2. **IR Sensors (PIR1 and PIR2)**: These sensors detect vehicles at the entrance and exit points of the garage. When a vehicle is detected by an IR sensor (i.e., IR sensor output changes), the microcontroller adjusts the count of cars in the garage.

3. **Servo Motors**: The project controls two servo motors using PWM signals generated by the ATmega32. The servos are used to open and close barriers or gates. The angle of the servos is controlled to allow or restrict entry and exit based on the IR sensor readings.

4. **LCD Display (LCD1)**: An LCD module (LM016L) is used to display messages about the number of cars currently in the garage and whether the garage has space available. The display updates based on the vehicle count managed by the microcontroller.

### Detailed Explanation :

1. **Logic for Entry and Exit**:
   - **Entry**: When the entry IR sensor (IR_1) detects a vehicle, and the garage is not full (count < 3), the microcontroller increments the car count, updates the LCD, and temporarily opens the entry barrier by adjusting the servo motor position.
   - **Exit**: When the exit IR sensor (IR_2) detects a vehicle, and there is at least one car in the garage (count > 0), the microcontroller decrements the car count, updates the LCD, and temporarily opens the exit barrier by adjusting the servo motor position.

2. **Car Count Limit**: The system is designed to manage a maximum of three cars in the garage. When the count reaches three, the LCD displays that the garage is full, and no more cars are allowed to enter until a car exits.

3. **PWM Generation for Servo Motors**: The project uses Timer1 in the ATmega32 to generate PWM signals required for controlling the servo motors. Functions `Servo_motor_with_TIMER1_fast_pwm_ICRA_wave_A` and `Servo_motor_with_TIMER1_fast_pwm_ICRA_wave_B` configure Timer1 for PWM output, adjusting the pulse width based on the desired angle for the servo to control the barriers.


This project automates the control of a garage gate system using sensors to detect car entry and exit and servo motors to open and close barriers, with real-time status displayed on an LCD screen.
